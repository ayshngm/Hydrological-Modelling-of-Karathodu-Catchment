# Hydrological-Modelling-of-Karathodu-Catchment
 Developing a model to calculate the Hydro-logical parameters in Karathodu catchment such that the modelled flow matches with the original flow in that basin.Performed in-depth study of the physiological parameters like Topography ,Land Use and Land cover to get an intrinsic idea about the catchment for our analysis .Employed a Top down approach with increasing order of complexity along with the inclusion of Hydrologic Response units and several buckets representing different Hydrologic phenomena.Study was conducted at Daily, Monthly and Yearly Time scales.Python language along with certain libraries like Numpy ,Pandas and Matplotlib were used forproper analysis of the data and visualizations.
